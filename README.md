# Stat390-Project

## Organization
The data preperation and eda was all done by the entire group. Each member then developed the models on their own and contained them in their own folder titled with their name and models (ex: `bens_models`)

## Working Strategy 
Each group member will work on their own branches for exploratory analysis and testing. As soon as they have accomplished their goal and the code is working, merge it into the main branch.

# Data Preparation and EDA
Data preparation and final datasets can be found in its own folder, data. Exploratory data analysis, developed in collaboration with all members, can also be found in its own folder, eda.

# Models
Each team member has a separate folder whcih contains their models (building, parameter tuning, plotting, etc.).These folders contain some, but not necessarily all, of the following models:
* ARIMA
* SARIMA
* AutoARIMA
* Prophet (univariate and multivariate are separate files)
* XGBoost
* LSTM
